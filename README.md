# Gesture-Recogniser

_This project was a part of a College Assignment_

This project involves developing a 2D gesture recognition system using the $1 Gesture Recognizer algorithm. The app allows users to draw gestures like arrows or circles, and recognizes them by comparing the input against stored gesture templates.

Key tasks include implementing gesture drawing on a canvas using mouse event handlers and completing the recognition process by resampling points, rotating gestures to align with the x-axis, scaling to a square, and translating to a common point. The recognition algorithm uses path-distance calculations to match user input with predefined templates. The project emphasizes object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithm implementation.

**Things I Learned:**

Capturing and drawing gestures with mouse event handlers.
Using Deques for efficient gesture data storage.
Applying the $1 Gesture Recognizer steps: resampling, rotation, scaling, and translation.
Debugging with visual aids and structured tests.
Building modular, object-oriented software for gesture recognition.
Minimizing recognition errors with path-distance calculations.
